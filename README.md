# 493FinalProject

Based one the scenario in our story board I think we need these pages
1. Home Page
2. Example page w/ a workout plan
3. Schedule page

I think our scenario should be:
1. Open Home page
2. Click on "Generate a Workout"
3. Switch to page w/ workout plan
4. Click on "Add to Schedule"
5. Switch to schedule page with new workout added in

I kinda like the look of just black, white, and tan but down to use others too

font-family: 'Poppins' (I used the same one as the first HW)

Also if yall wanna change the name thats cool too
